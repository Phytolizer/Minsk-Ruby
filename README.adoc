Minsk is a programming language, originally written in C# by Immo Landwerth.
This is my attempt to reimplement its functionality in Ruby.

Dependencies
------------
* Ruby v3.0.2

Usage
-----
Install deps: `gem install bundler && bundle install`.

Run `bundle exec rake` to run the tests.

Run `bundle exec rake run` to run the REPL.
